## React + Apollo + GraphQL + NodeJS + MongoDB StarterKit
* Showcases a sample app
* Containers and presentational components created
* Uses Apollo as GraphQL client
* Connecting GraphQL with React using Apollo
* GraphQL queries to get data from GraphQL server
* Uses Jest for running unit test
* Uses Sass for styles for better management, although you can you CSS(.css files as well)
* Can add your own test using extension *.test.js
* Can check the npm bundler/build scripts inside node_modules/react-scripts

##### This project aims at helping kickstarting a new React + Apollo + GraphQL + NodeJS + MongoDB project.

* Step 1: cd into client folder(i.e current folder)
* Step 2: do npm install or yarn install

#### Versions being used
* React v16+
* Node 8+
* NPM 6.2.0

##### Use following scripts to run this project on development mode, create production build and run unit tests

## Available Scripts
###### uses [React-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) for build creation and running tests
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

For Pull Requests
Aim is to keep this repository as simple and light as we can, only add packages which actually increases the productivity or app performance i.e raise PR for a must to have package/feature, looking forward to contributions.
